              <h2>About me</h2>
              <p>
                Young engineer, I really love new technologies and the challenges they represent in
                our current society. I particularly enjoy web development, <i>data mining</i>
                and Devops activities.
              </p>
              <p>
                After five years of study at INSA Rouen-Normandie in the Department of Architecture
                of Information Systems where I specialized in the web and <i>data mining</i>, I
                decided to realize my end of studies project at <strong>Takima</strong>. The high
                level of technical requirements and the importance of human relations in this
                society were two factors behind my decision to embark on this adventure.
              </p>
              <p>
                On the other hand, I was lucky to be able to follow the &quot;Takima Academy&quot;
                course, a 10-week training during which my skills were increased tenfold, especially
                those around the Java, web and Devops environments. During this training, I also
                learned about good development practices, code quality, the importance of tests, and
                agile methodologies.
              </p>
              <p>
                From 2018 to 2020, I worked at <strong>Cartier</strong> as a consultant, where I
                built several fullstack applications to improve the working conditions and
                performance of craftsmen in luxury jewelry manufacturing workshops.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2020, I decided to join <strong>Kannelle</strong> and the world of startups in
                order to have more responsibilities and get better technically. I was in charge of
                developing from scratch an administration platform enabling to configure the
                experience within the mobile application, as well as a video editor. During the
                mission, I was also given the responsibility for the back-end, DevOps and cloud
                architecture.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2022, I took part in a great adventure by joining a french unicorn:{' '}
                <strong>Swile</strong> ðŸ¦„. Working in the &quot;Places&quot; team as a full stack
                engineer, I am in charge of developing many features related to the geolocation of
                the restaurants and shops affiliated with Swile, enhancing the existing product,
                contributing to the roadmap, etc.
